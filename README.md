# Student-Assessment-System
The objective of this project is to improve the functionalities of student assessment system. 
It is somewhat difficult to fill up data and their information for further use as there are very less divisions or section for different types of details. 
So the software required to be re-designed or re-develop further. 
So i get different sections of forms as well as their respective records which make it more user friendly and time saving for both user (employee and student).
For assigning every student’s identification number it requires a Student Id first which means student information file number for each student containing student’s             information in that file. For each student the owner maintains some files such as:-
           a. ID:- Student Identification number.
           b. Univ_no:- University number of Student.
           c. Course_Code:- Course Code of Student.
           d. Sem_no:- Semester number of Student.
           e. Batch_Code:-Batch Code of Student.
This project was very challenging from various aspects as it has the database of complex type and links as well as access from other branches also. So i had to maintain Sid, Univ_no, Course_Code, Batch_Code and Sem_no of all students for this software.
To achieve all these processes, I have used java due to its user friendly tools to develop interface and compatibility with branch’s system and mysql workbench for maintaining the database, as mysql is secure, sharable, accurate and consistent perspective.  
I have tried to make the software very flexible, for further re-development and changes required in changing time.
